We are trying to predict how good a team will perform in a particualar NBA season and we do this by predicting 5 different measures of goodness which are:
  1. Whether or not a team will win over 50% of games
  2. Whether or not a team will qualify for the playoffs
  3. Whether or not a team will win in the playoffs
  4. Whether or not a team will make it to the season finals
  5. Whether or not a team will be the champions of that season
  
 We do this by using Decision tree model and K-nearest neighbors. We have also applied Leave One Out Cross Validation for both these models along with feature reduction and feature selection for KNN.
